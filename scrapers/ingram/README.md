### Technologies

The application is built on `Javascript ES6` (with some ES7 features like `async/await`, `import/export` module syntax) and runs on `NodeJS`. 
The code is transpiled down to `Javascript ES5` using `babel` and bundled into a single file usnig `webpack`. 
The code is sometimes type checked using [Facebook Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

### Development environment

You'll need to have `node`, `npm`, and `webpack` at the very least. The project has been tested to work with `node-v6.3.1`, `npm-v.3.10.5`, and `webpack-v.1.13.1`. `webpack` must be installed globally via: 

`$ npm install -g webpack`.

The rest of the dependencies will be local. To install them you need to run: 

`$ npm install` 

inside the application directory.

To make sure the application build correctly run:

`$ webpack`

which should issue no errors and output a `bundle.js` file to `/dist`.
